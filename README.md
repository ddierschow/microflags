<h1>&micro;Flags of the World</h1><p><hr><p>

The original intention of these flags were for use as in-line graphics with text.
These flags have been designed to be of a correct aspect ratio,
most with a height of 12 to 14 pixels, but some as little as 9 or as many as 16.
The widths mostly range from 13 to 28 pixels, with the smallest being 7 and the largest 33.
The sizes are less than a twelve hundred <u>bytes</u>, and most are under 300!
They have also been designed with web-safe colors.
The image files have been named with the ISO3166 country codes for entities that have these codes assigned.
